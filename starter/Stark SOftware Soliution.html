        Stark Industries is depicted as being owned and run by businessman and
        namesake Tony Stark, who is also known as Iron Man, and was founded by
        Tony's father, Howard Stark, from whom he inherited the company.

      Stark Industries is a multinational industrial company and the largest
      tech conglomerate in the world. Founded in 1939 by Howard Stark, the elder
      Stark ran the company from its inception up until his death in 1991, after
      which Obadiah Stane was appointed interim CEO, with Tony Stark officially
      assuming the position shortly after at the age of twenty-one. Under
      Stark's control, the company flourished financially for nearly two
      decades; however, when Stark discovered that Stane was selling their
      weapons to terrorist groups around the world, such as the Ten Rings, he
      shut down their lucrative weapons division. In 2010, Stark appointed
      Pepper Potts as the CEO of Stark Industries after realizing that he was
      dying from palladium poisoning, a position that Stark allowed Potts to
      maintain after he engineered his own recovery.
